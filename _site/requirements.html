          <h1 id="requirements">Requirements</h1>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>The subject of these requirements is an existing web-based GIS application. The application is currently used for collaboration around utility engineering projects and services. In general, the application serves as a central repository of geographic information, and it allows users to create and share content with fine granularity.</p>

<p>It should be noted that specifying the wide range of current functionality is beyond the scope of this document; it is assumed that current functions will be retained. However, this document does provide requirements for changes to existing functionality.</p>

<p>Additionally, there is an administrative area of the application which supports management of data and permissions as well as creation of users and groups. This area is beyond the scope of this project.</p>

<h2 id="concepts">Concepts</h2>

<p>Content in the application comes in several forms. The most atomic of these is a <em>geometry</em> (or “object” or “geometry object”). A geometry may be either a point, a line, or a polygon, and represents a physical entity somewhere on the globe. A geometry may have files and attributes associated with it, as well. A layer consists of a set of geometries and defines the possible attributes for its child geometries. A <em>layer</em> may also consist solely of a set of sub-layers. A <em>service</em> consists of a set of related layers. A <em>layout</em> is a saved view of a set of services along with the visibility of those services and layers. For the purposes of this document, a <em>walkthrough</em> can be understood as a set of layouts linked together in sequence.</p>

<p>At present, there are two primary pages for the application. The first, which we can call the <em>menu page</em> or “main page”, consists of a menu of content which users can select to view on the map page. The <em>map page</em> is the page in the application where users spend the majority of their time. It consists of a central “map area” which displays a map view as well several peripheral panes which display loaded layers, search options, selection properties, and visible layers. At the top of the map page is a toolbar.</p>

<p>Lastly, it is important to understand the idea of a <em>spatial query</em>. A spatial query is a process by which geometries related to a selected geometry may be discovered. In this application, this involves selecting a set of layers to include in the search (or query), selecting a geometry to query on, and entering any information needed for the query. For instance, a user may select a layer containing poles on which to perform the query, then select an underground pipe to query with, and finally enter a distance from the pipe centerline to search. This spatial query would return all of the poles within the given distance of the pipe centerline.</p>

<h2 id="target-audience">Target Audience</h2>

<p>The target audience consists of the current users of the application. Around half are young adults who tend to be more tech savvy while the other half are an older crowd (40s and 50s) who are generally not as comfortable with technology. Some of the users primarily work outside as utility locators whereas others primarily work inside as engineers. Around two thirds of users believe they use the application primarily for viewing existing content, almost a third think they use it primarily for authoring content, and a small number use it mostly for presentations.</p>

<p>For our purposes, “presenter users” can be seen as a secondary audience, where the remaining user groups make up the primary audience. Furthermore, there are generally three forms of presentation or large-screen usage of the application. One is largely a walkthrough of functionality, particularly functionality which sets the application apart from other similar applications. Another is the telling of a project story (for sales purposes) using the application. And the last is using the application in project-related meetings.</p>

<h2 id="daphne">Daphne</h2>
<p>Daphne is a 26-year-old civil engineer. She works on a variety of projects within the company. Though she’s generally tech-savvy, she gets really frustrated when applications she uses don’t work as she expects. One of her tasks one week was to enter the geographies, attributes, and files for thirty different records into the system. Although she knew where to get all of the information for each record, she got frustrated at how many steps it took to save each record. She even lost a few records because they were only saved in her session, even though they looked like they’d been saved to the server. This cost her extra time and required her to stay late one night.</p>

<h2 id="mark">Mark</h2>
<p>Mark is a 53-year-old utility locator. His job entails working outdoors using a rugged laptop. He’s accustomed to some level of technology at work, but it’s not something that comes easily for him. After returning from an extended vacation in January, he found himself assigned to an unfamiliar area to cover for someone else on vacation. He needed to freshly download detailed drawings stored on the system for this new area, but this cost him quite a bit of time as he had to select each individual asset to download the files.</p>

<h2 id="jim">Jim</h2>
<p>Jim is a 47-year-old sales manager. He’s a high-energy guy who always seems to be on-the-go. Although he generally works out of the office, he often travels to various clients and potential clients to run meetings and presentations. Most client offices have laptop hookups in their meeting rooms, but some do not have reliable internet connections. Jim likes to use the GIS application in sales pitches, but often just takes screenshots rather than risk not being able to load data for the presentation. When he does give a presentation with the application, the presentation screen is sometimes cluttered with extraneous information from the application which is confusing to meeting attendees.</p>
